# Chess3D
Chess3D is an improved version of my coursework project [Chess](https://github.com/.../Chess](https://github.com/MaryanaIvanina/Chess)).  
It was developed as a standalone project with extended functionality, redesigned visuals, and a cleaner codebase.

## Implemented Features
- Full 8x8 chessboard with all pieces.
- Correct move logic for every piece according to chess rules.
- Turn-based gameplay (white → black).
- Piece capturing mechanics.
- Castling.
- Switching camera views (3 predefined positions).
- Built-in rules of chess.
- Ability to end the game anytime.
- **Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection.**
- **Pawn promotion (choice of a new piece when reaching the last rank).**

## Technologies Used
- **Unity (C#)** — core gameplay and mechanics.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming** and design patterns for structured code.  
- **Canvas UI System** for interface and menu.  
- **Raycasting** for interaction and piece movement.
